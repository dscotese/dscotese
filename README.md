- 👋 Hi, I’m @dscotese
- 👀 I’m interested in Cryptocurrency, Consciousness, Coding, Conscience, and [Writing](https://litmocracy.blogspot.com).  There are too many other things to list.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to free people from their own internal prisons.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of local communities committed to [voluntaryism](https://voluntaryist.com) and the software that will support them.
- 📫 You you can sign up for [my mailing list](http://eepurl.com/Pp7jf). - I was using it to keep my customers informed and also encourage others to deal bitcoin until I got arrested. It also explains more about how to avoid scammers. Here's [the newsletter archive](http://goo.gl/ZNjWe9).
